# My tiny progress..
Tonight I've accomplished nothing toward's my projects. Like I said a few days ago, I'm working on really understanding how things work.  Despite of putting in countless hours, it's been ab it slow going. The way I've been feeling lately has really slowed me down. Maybe someday I'll tell the story of how I came to like this. For now, we'll stick to coding. 

# **Ajax vs Fetch!**

Very dramatic title right? Well the truth is they're basically the same thing. Using Jquery to make an ajax request is just an older way of doing fetch. Fetch is a way that's native to browsers and supposed to work on ALL browsers. Here's what [Mozilla Devloper Network - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) has to say : 
>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.

My reason for mentioning this is that I'm deciding whether to use ajax or fetch for my Cell project. I'm leaning hard on fetch. Now if only I could get it to work...
