Like most aspiring developers, I think that it would be very beneficial for me to blog about any and all progress I make in my journey to becoming employed.
I've been toying with the idea of being an "actual" programmer, for the last 2 years. I probably did what most people my age do when they first start out; complete beginner tutorials on various languages in a totally disconjointed manner. 
I suppose it's a necessary evil in order to fumble through this skill and figure out what tools exist and what they're for.

The worst part in the beginning is trying to figure out what to make and what is worthwhile. Then the challenge becomes welcoming. I learned just enough to be proud and excited, only to realize moments later that I was naive and still just a child sitting with adults.
And so to completely oversimplify things that's how I see this journey.

>Surrounded by darkness, I obtain knowledge to create light, upon creating light I start to see just how little my world is, and at the same time I see just how endlessly overwhelming the amount of darkness that surrounds me is.
