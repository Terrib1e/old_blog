<p> Today is the last day I'll get to see my girlfriend Janet forever. Actually just the month of July. She's going to be visiting her family in Mexico. I'm excited for her, albeit a bit nervous as well (Mexico isn't exactly the safest country...).Besides that major life disturbance, this month is going to be super important. </p>

Today is July 01, 2017. It's my brother's birthday. He passed away on February 24th, 2015.  His name was Justin Clark, and I miss him so much every day.

<p>This month is when I'm going to finally try to transition to a new level in web development. I'll be completing a portfolio and by August 1st, I hope to be ready to take things to the next level, and apply for jobs. Part of that will include some of the following:</p>

1. Finish her smart mirror.
2. Become more proficient in Cell JS by practiing using [THIS](https://daveceddia.com/learn-react-with-copywork)  
3. Stop trying to see the big picture and just focus on what's in front of me.

   I find it difficult and overwhelming to hit these milestones of understanding and then realize there's a neverending mountain I need to climb to reach the top.

   It feels like I'm a child sitting at the big kid's table during development conversations on github or slack.
4â‹… Exercise and eat healthier than you ever have.
5. I've quit energy drinks, coffee, most sugary things, and I've been eating the way Janet does. It feels good.
