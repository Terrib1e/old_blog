able to accomplish more than I've ever thought possible.</p>

I've begun using [Cell JS][http://www.celljs.org/]. It may just be the timing, but it's really helped things click. **What happens now though?**

#### I become aware of my limitations

I acheive and celebrate these milestones but it's alaways short lived. I learn just enough to realize I know nothing. I feel like a child sitting at the adult table, or 
like the only person who can't speak spanish at a hispanic party. I smile, nod, laugh, attempt to mimic what's said or done, and hoppe that I learn just enough, so that next
time I can be that much more fluid and fluent.
