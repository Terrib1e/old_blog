<h1> What am I doing?</h1>
<hr>
<p> I suppose asking that question is both a great thing and a way of getting depressed.</p>
<p>I'd like to think I'm dedicating myself to learning web design so that I can better my life AND get to do something I enjoy.</p>
<p>Ideally that would definitely be the case...BUT the truth is, I'm still not giving this my all. I've learned a tremendous amount</p>
<p>in only 4 weeks. It's definitely not something I'd take back. </p>
