#WikiViewer
Slowly but surely I've been working my way through (FreeCodeCamp)[https://freecodecamp.com](. I've spent so much time in between assignments that I've had to go back and redo many of the lessons. Sometimes, like with truly understanding API's, I've made the decision to go back so that I can make sure I'm able to utilize it fully for projects.
That's what I've done while working on the WikiViewer project. I'm still in the early stages of plotting it out, but i'm utilizing both the (wikiviewer API sandbox)[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page] and misc. projects or parts from (CodePen)[https://codepen.io].
So far it's going 'ok'. I have it basically worked out, I'm just having an issue getting the Javascript to work with Cell. I think I need to refactor it and convert it to Cell.
