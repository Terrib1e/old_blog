## _*Finally!!!*_

It turns out that if you throw enough time and effort at something, you just might figure it out. I spend  *WAY* too many hours trying to convert the [WikiViewer project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer) to [Cell JS](https://www.celljs.org).

I finally pulled it all together and learned how to use an API properly. Now I'll do the same with [Twitch API Project from FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api). 

It's a good feeling. I'll add these to my [Projects](https://terrib1e.github.io/projects) page when I get a couple more completed. 

I'm really hoping that someday soon I'll be able to transition toa  junior dev job. I know I have a TON to learn, but I'm doing it! It's so exciting honestly. It's kind of embarrassing how ecstatic I am about this all. I wish I had someone to share it with. My girlfriend Janet is a goddess but she's not someone that cares about prife filled personal achievements. I love her regardless, but I cneed to meet more people and exchange more code with people in order to learn and progress to the next level.
