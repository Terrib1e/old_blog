# **Home Sweet Home**

My love has returned from Mexico. A whole month away from me and now she has returned. It feels good. I really would like to focus more on programming with this. It's kind of a waste to just talk about my personal life and not leave a record of anything I'm learninig. In fact, I think I'm going to create a separate blog and host it on my server. That or learn how to categorize a bit better.
