Today I worked on getting my raspberry pi to stream its camera from the server I installed on it. I'll post the progress I've made on that and on the Smart Mirror, tomorrow at some point. 
I really need to figure out a better way of a going about things.  I really need to work on adding my projects so that, maybe you, the reader, will be willing to take a chance and see that I'm worth taking a chance on.
