## _*NEXT STEPS_*

Well here we go again. I successfully finish my WikiViewer, and now it's time to go for the next learning experience. I'll be working on the [Twitch API](#) project from freecodecamp, and like th elast one, I'll be using Cell to do most of the heavy lifting and organizing.  

Outside of that project I need to:

* Build my project/portfolio page.
* Add a Resume/CV page.
* Keep working through FCC.
* Create a seaparate blog unrelated to this (*more info to come*)
* Build ONE unique app (*more info to come*)
* Find some sort of semi-professional / volunteer jobs related to design.
    * This is especially important because if I could just get a few gigs under my belt I'd finally be able to do somrthing I love. 

How long until I'm able to improve my skill enouh to find or create a meaningful career?
