Today is the first day of my month long intense evolution. I am going to show myself and the world that I'm able to accomplish more than I've ever thought possible.

### Cell JS to ....
I've begun using [Cell JS][http://www.celljs.org/]. It may just be the timing, but it's really helped things click. 

**What happens now though?**

<u>I become aware of my limitations</u>
======================================

I acheive and celebrate these milestones but it's always short lived. I learn just enough to realize I know nothing. I feel like a child sitting at the adult table, or 
like the only person who can't speak spanish at a hispanic party. I smile, nod, laugh, attempt to mimic what's said or done, and hoppe that I learn just enough, so that next
time I can be that much more fluid and fluent.
