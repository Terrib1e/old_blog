I'm kind of a fool sometimes. I'm also kind of a immobilized at the moment. My body is giving up on me. I've put it through too much i suppose. My resting pulse is between 100-110. If I move it goes to 125. I feel like with each **beat** of my heart I'm losing precious seconds of life. 

All of this I attribute to sleep. Well the lack of sleep I'm getting. I may sleep for 8 hours, but I'm barely breathing. I'm gasping for air and never hitting REM. It's cause me to gain weight, become forgetful, and it casues this heart to beat erratically and waste my precious lifeforce.
